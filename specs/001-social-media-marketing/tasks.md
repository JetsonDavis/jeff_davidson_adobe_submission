## Validation Checklist

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (15 endpoints, 34 contract tests created)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (5 entities: Brief, Asset, Idea, Creative, Approval)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2 before 3.3-3.6)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files, marked [P])
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No [P] task modifies same file as another [P] task

## Notes

- **TDD Critical**: Do NOT implement endpoints before contract tests exist and fail
- **File Paths**: All paths are absolute and specific to avoid ambiguity
- **Parallel Safety**: [P] tasks modify different files and have no dependencies
- **Migration Order**: Database migrations must run sequentially (T026-T031)
- **API Registration**: Don't forget T071 to register routers in main.py
- **Environment**: Set up .env file with DATABASE_URL, LLM_API_KEY, FIREFLY_API_KEY before running

## Estimated Task Count
**Total: 104 tasks**
- Setup: 11 tasks
- Tests: 19 tasks (contract + integration + component)
- Database: 12 tasks (migrations + models + schemas)
- Services: 10 tasks
- API Endpoints: 19 tasks
- Frontend: 13 tasks
- Integration: 7 tasks
- Polish: 13 tasks

## Success Criteria
✅ All 34 contract tests pass  
✅ All 5 integration test scenarios pass  
✅ All quickstart scenarios execute successfully  
✅ Database migrations run without errors  
✅ Frontend responsive on all devices  
✅ Performance targets met (<1s uploads, <30s generation)
