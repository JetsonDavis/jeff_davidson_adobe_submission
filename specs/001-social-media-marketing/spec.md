# Feature Specification: Social Media Marketing Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-social-media-marketing`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "social media marketing dashboard with product briefs, asset uploads, LLM-generated ideas, and Adobe Firefly creative generation"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A marketing manager needs to create social media campaigns for multiple products from their brand. They upload product briefs (either typed or as documents), brand assets, and product images. The system generates creative ideas tailored to different regions and demographics, then produces final social media creatives. The manager reviews and approves content before deploying it to social media platforms.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a marketing manager has product information, **When** they upload a product brief document and associated assets, **Then** the system stores all materials and displays thumbnails with delete options
2. **Given** uploaded brief and assets exist, **When** the manager clicks Execute, **Then** the system generates one creative idea per region/demographic combination specified in the brief
3. **Given** generated ideas are displayed, **When** the manager clicks the regenerate button, **Then** a new idea replaces the current one for that region/demographic
4. **Given** an approved idea exists, **When** the manager clicks the play button, **Then** the system generates final creative assets and adds them to the approval queue
5. **Given** a creative is in the approval queue, **When** both creative and regional approvals are granted, **Then** the deploy button becomes active
6. **Given** the deploy button is active, **When** clicked, **Then** the creative shows a "deployed" banner and is marked as live

### Edge Cases
- What happens when uploaded documents are corrupted or unreadable? If there is an error with a document, display the error on the screen and ask that the user re-upload the document.  If the error is with an image, use firefly to generate the image.
- How does the system handle LLM generation failures or timeouts?
Same thing here, if the LLM fails, display the error on the screen and ask that the user re-run the Execute command.
- What occurs when Adobe Firefly creative generation fails?
Same thing here, if the Firefly fails, display the error on the screen and ask that the user re-run the Play command.
- How are conflicting approvals (creative approved but regional rejected) handled?  Both approvals must be granted before the deploy button becomes active.  If one is granted and the other is rejected, the deploy button should remain inactive.
- What happens when users try to deploy without both approvals?
The deploy button should remain inactive until both approvals are granted.
