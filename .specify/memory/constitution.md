# Spec Kit Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Specification-First Development
Every feature MUST begin with a complete, unambiguous specification before any implementation planning or coding begins. Specifications MUST be written for business stakeholders, not developers, focusing on WHAT users need and WHY, never HOW to implement. All ambiguities MUST be marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] and resolved before proceeding to planning phase.

**Rationale**: Prevents scope creep, ensures stakeholder alignment, and reduces implementation rework by catching requirements issues early.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All implementation MUST follow strict TDD: Tests written → Tests fail → Implementation → Tests pass. Contract tests MUST be written for all API endpoints before implementation. Integration tests MUST validate all user stories. No implementation code may be written until corresponding tests exist and fail.

**Rationale**: Ensures code quality, validates requirements understanding, and provides regression protection throughout development lifecycle.

### III. Structured Workflow Gates
Development MUST proceed through mandatory phases with quality gates: Specification → Planning → Task Generation → Implementation → Validation. Each phase has specific deliverables and cannot proceed until gate criteria are met. Constitution compliance MUST be verified at specification and post-design checkpoints.

**Rationale**: Maintains quality standards, prevents technical debt accumulation, and ensures consistent delivery across all features.

### IV. Documentation-Driven Design
All design decisions MUST be documented with rationale, alternatives considered, and trade-offs evaluated. Research findings MUST be consolidated before design begins. API contracts MUST be generated from functional requirements using standard patterns. Agent context files MUST be maintained incrementally to preserve institutional knowledge.

**Rationale**: Enables knowledge transfer, supports future maintenance decisions, and provides audit trail for architectural choices.

### V. Simplicity and Justification
All complexity MUST be justified against simpler alternatives. Violations of established patterns MUST be documented in Complexity Tracking with specific rationale. YAGNI principles apply - implement only what is specified, not what might be needed. Default to proven patterns unless specific requirements demand deviation.

**Rationale**: Reduces maintenance burden, improves code comprehension, and prevents over-engineering that doesn't deliver user value.

### VII. Responsive Design
All web interfaces MUST be responsive and functional across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports. Mobile-first design approach MUST be used. Touch targets MUST meet minimum size requirements (44px). Performance on mobile networks MUST be optimized.

**Rationale**: Ensures consistent user experience across all devices and optimizes for the growing mobile user base.

### VIII. Infrastructure Standards
All applications MUST use the approved technology stack: Python backend, React frontend, AWS RDS/DynamoDB for persistence, Redis for queuing. Infrastructure MUST be defined as code. Database schemas MUST support both Postgres patterns appropriately.

**Rationale**: Ensures consistency, leverages team expertise, and maintains supportable infrastructure with proven scalability patterns.

## Quality Standards

### Requirement Completeness
All specifications MUST have testable, unambiguous requirements with measurable success criteria. Scope MUST be clearly bounded with dependencies and assumptions identified. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers may remain in approved specifications.

### Technical Consistency
All features MUST follow established project structure patterns (web application: backend/frontend separation). Technology choices MUST be consistent within project scope unless justified by specific requirements. Agent context files MUST reflect actual technology stack in use.

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **Backend**: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI or Django framework
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with JavaScript, responsive CSS framework
- **Database**: Local PostgreSQL) for relational data
- **Queuing**: Simulate queueing with Postgres
- **Testing**: pytest (backend), Jest/React Testing Library (frontend)

## Development Workflow

### Phase Execution
- **Specification Phase**: /specify command creates complete feature spec with all ambiguities resolved
- **Planning Phase**: /plan command generates technical design, contracts, and structure decisions
- **Task Generation**: /tasks command creates ordered, dependency-aware implementation tasks
- **Implementation**: Execute tasks following TDD principles with constitution compliance
- **Validation**: Run all tests, execute quickstart scenarios, verify performance targets

### Parallel Execution Rules
Tasks marked [P] may execute in parallel only if they modify different files and have no dependencies. Same-file modifications MUST be sequential. Test tasks MUST complete before corresponding implementation tasks.

### Change Management
All template updates MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing features. Constitution changes MUST include impact analysis and migration plan for affected templates. Version increments MUST follow semantic versioning: MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for new principles, PATCH for clarifications.

## Governance

### Constitutional Authority
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All feature development MUST comply with these principles. Deviations require explicit justification in Complexity Tracking sections with approval from project stakeholders.

### Compliance Verification
All specifications and plans MUST include Constitution Check sections verifying adherence to core principles. Template files MUST reference current constitution version. Agent context updates MUST preserve constitutional compliance while adding new technical context.
